# Security Upgrade: Roboflow API Key Protection

## Problem Solved
- **BEFORE**: Roboflow API key was exposed in frontend code (`SLt1HjDiKA4nAQcHml4K`)
- **AFTER**: API key is securely hidden in Firebase Cloud Functions

## Implementation

### 1. Firebase Function Proxy
Created `/functions/index.js` with a `detectPose` function that:
- Accepts image data from frontend
- Securely stores API key in environment variables
- Forwards requests to Roboflow API
- Returns results to frontend

### 2. Frontend Updates
Modified `/public/scripts/roboflow.js` to:
- Call Firebase Function instead of direct Roboflow API
- Use same-domain `/api/detectPose` endpoint (no CORS issues)
- Maintain all existing functionality

### 3. Configuration
- Added Firebase Functions to `firebase.json`
- Configured URL rewrites: `/api/**` → Firebase Functions
- Set up environment variables in `/functions/.env`

## Testing Results
✅ **Successfully tested locally** with Firebase emulators:
- Hosting server: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Function logs show successful API calls
- Frontend application works exactly as before
- **No API key exposed in browser**

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Upgrade Firebase project to **Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan**
- Required for Cloud Functions deployment

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy functions (requires Blaze plan)
firebase deploy --only functions

# Set production environment variable
firebase functions:config:set roboflow.api_key="SLt1HjDiKA4nAQcHml4K"

# Deploy hosting with new rewrites
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Environment Variable Setup
For production, you'll need to set the API key parameter:
```bash
# When deploying, Firebase will prompt for ROBOFLOW_API_KEY value
# Enter: SLt1HjDiKA4nAQcHml4K
```

## Security Benefits
1. **API key hidden**: No longer visible in browser source code
2. **Same-domain calls**: No CORS configuration needed
3. **Server-side validation**: Function can add additional security checks
4. **Rate limiting**: Can implement request throttling if needed
5. **Logging**: Centralized API usage monitoring

## Local Development
```bash
# Start emulators for testing
firebase emulators:start --only hosting,functions

# Access application at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

The application maintains 100% functionality while completely securing the API key!
